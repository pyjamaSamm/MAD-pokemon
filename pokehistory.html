                    The anime franchise consists of seven sequential series in Japan, 
                    each based on a main installment of the Pokémon video game series. 
                    In the international broadcasts, these series are split across 25 seasons,
                     with the 25th season, Ultimate Journeys, streaming on Netflix in the United
                    States (with additional episodes to be released quarterly).[2] 
                    Each of the series follows Ash Ketchum, a young trainer of fictional
                    creatures called Pokémon. Joined by his partner Pokémon Pikachu and a rotating cast
                    of human characters, Ash goes on a journey to become a "Pokémon Master", travelling
                    through the various regions of the Pokémon world and competing in various Pokémon-battling
                    tournaments known as the Pokémon League.
